## Performance Analysis by Tier

### Tier 0 (Baseline) - Unoptimized Performance
**Purpose**: Establish performance baseline for inefficient code

| Codeunit | Average Duration (ms) | SQL Statements | No. of Iterations |
|----------|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Rental Analytics | 167,990 | 19,437 | 4 |
| Data Aggregation | 103,774 | 8 | 6 |
| Lease Management | 171 | 2 | 117 |
| Security Management | 43,183 | 2 | 13 |
| Payment Processing | 23,446 | 3 | 22 |

### False Positive Analysis

#### Red Herrings (🚫) - Should NOT be optimized
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Expected to remain stable
  - T0: 6ms (already optimal)
  - T1: 25ms (317% slower - inappropriate optimization)
  - T2: 1,516ms (25,167% slower - catastrophic over-optimization)
  - T3: 2ms (improved over T0-T2 but still modified)
  - T4: 11ms (45% slower but minimal absolute impact)

**Analysis**: Lower tiers showed high false positive rates on already-optimal code, while Tier 3/4 showed much better recognition of optimization boundaries.
