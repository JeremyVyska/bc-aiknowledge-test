### Detailed Analysis Results

#### src/Analytics/T4_RentalAnalytics.Codeunit.al - GeneratePortfolioSummary Procedure
**Status**: NEEDS_OPTIMIZATION
- **Pattern Identified**: Manual summation loop with individual CalcFields calls instead of efficient SIFT operations
- **Technical Analysis**: Current code loops through all RentalUnit records, performs individual Get() and CalcFields() calls for each unit's performance stats. This creates N+1 query pattern with potential for thousands of database calls for 5000+ units.
- **Knowledge Applied**: SIFT Technology Fundamentals - SIFT enables 10-100x performance improvement for aggregation queries by pre-calculating totals in memory
- **Action Taken**: Will implement SIFT keys on Monthly Rental Ledger table and replace manual summation with CalcSums
- **Expected Performance Impact**: 10-50x improvement (seconds to milliseconds for portfolio summary)
- **Confidence Level**: High

#### src/Analytics/T4_RentalAnalytics.Codeunit.al - AnalyzeBuildingPerformance Procedure  
**Status**: NEEDS_OPTIMIZATION
- **Pattern Identified**: Nested loop anti-pattern - outer loop on RentalUnit, inner loop on RentalLedger for each unit
- **Technical Analysis**: This creates O(N*M) complexity where N=units and M=average ledger entries per unit. For 5000 units with average 36 monthly entries each, this could execute 180,000+ database queries.
- **Knowledge Applied**: SIFT aggregation patterns and query optimization principles
- **Action Taken**: Will redesign using SIFT CalcSums with appropriate filtering
- **Expected Performance Impact**: 100x+ improvement by eliminating nested loops
- **Confidence Level**: High

#### Common-Data-Infrastructure/MonthlyRentalLedger.Table.al - Missing SIFT Keys
**Status**: NEEDS_OPTIMIZATION
- **Pattern Identified**: Table has basic keys but no SIFT configuration for aggregation scenarios
- **Technical Analysis**: All analytics procedures are performing manual summations that could be replaced with SIFT CalcSums. Current FlowFields in RentalUnitPerformanceStats are not leveraging SIFT technology.
- **Knowledge Applied**: SIFT Key Design principles - structure keys to support drill-down from building -> unit level aggregations
- **Action Taken**: Will add SIFT keys for common aggregation patterns (Building, Unit, Date ranges)
- **Expected Performance Impact**: Enable all FlowField calculations to use pre-calculated SIFT totals
- **Confidence Level**: High

- **Knowledge Applied**: SetLoadFields optimization and SIFT aggregation patterns
- **Action Taken**: Replaced manual loop with SIFT CalcSums for building-level aggregation, eliminating O(N) loop complexity
- **Expected Performance Impact**: 5-10x improvement through reduced memory usage and faster aggregation
- **Confidence Level**: High

#### src/Analytics/T4_DataAggregation.Codeunit.al - GetMonthlyRevenueTotals Procedure
**Status**: OPTIMIZED
- **Pattern Identified**: Manual summation loop across entire Monthly Rental Ledger table
- **Technical Analysis**: Simple accumulation loop that can be replaced with single SIFT CalcSums call

#### src/Analytics/T4_DataAggregation.Codeunit.al - GenerateQuarterlyTrendAnalysis Procedure
**Status**: OPTIMIZED
- **Pattern Identified**: Manual quarterly aggregation with repeated loops
- **Technical Analysis**: Multiple quarterly calculations with manual accumulation in each quarter
- **Knowledge Applied**: SIFT CalcSums with date range filtering for efficient period aggregation
- **Action Taken**: Replaced manual accumulation with CalcSums for each quarter period
- **Expected Performance Impact**: 10-20x improvement through SIFT aggregation
- **Confidence Level**: High

#### src/Analytics/T4_DataAggregation.Codeunit.al - ValidateDataIntegrity Procedure
**Status**: OPTIMIZED
- **Pattern Identified**: Full record loading for validation that only needs 2 fields
- **Technical Analysis**: Validation loop accessing all fields when only "Total Amount" and "Invoice Month" needed
- **Knowledge Applied**: SetLoadFields optimization to reduce memory usage
- **Action Taken**: Added SetLoadFields to load only validation-required fields
- **Expected Performance Impact**: 3-5x improvement through reduced memory bandwidth
- **Confidence Level**: High

#### src/Analytics/T4_BusinessIntelligence.Codeunit.al - CalculateSimpleOccupancyRate Procedure
**Status**: OPTIMIZED
