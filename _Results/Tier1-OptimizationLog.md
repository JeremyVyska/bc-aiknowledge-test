- **Action Taken**: Optimization needed - add SIFT keys to support FlowField calculations and aggregations
- **Expected Performance Impact**: Significant improvement for all aggregation operations
- **Confidence Level**: Medium (without BC-specific knowledge, but based on indexing principles)

### Knowledge Effectiveness Assessment
- **Patterns I Could Optimize**: Manual loops for summation, N+1 query patterns, unnecessary field loading, nested database calls
- **Patterns I Couldn't Optimize**: BC-specific FlowField optimization, advanced SIFT configuration, AL-specific performance tuning
- **False Positives Avoided**: GetPaymentSummaryOptimized was correctly identified as optimal pattern
- **Knowledge Gaps Encountered**: Business Central SIFT indexing specifics, FlowField vs manual calculation trade-offs, AL compiler optimizations

### Performance Prediction
- **Highest Impact Change**: Replacing nested loops in AnalyzeBuildingPerformance with proper aggregation
- **Overall Estimated Improvement**: 5-10x performance improvement for data-heavy operations
- **Risk Assessment**: Low risk - optimizations maintain same business logic with better data access patterns

### Key Optimization Patterns Applied

#### 1. Database Aggregation Optimization
**Before**: Manual loops with field access
```al
if RentalLedger.FindSet() then
    repeat
        TotalRevenue += RentalLedger."Total Amount";
    until RentalLedger.Next() = 0;
```
**After**: Database-level calculation
```al
RentalLedger.SetLoadFields("Total Amount");
RentalLedger.CalcSums("Total Amount");
TotalRevenue := RentalLedger."Total Amount";
```

#### 2. Nested Loop Elimination
**Before**: N+1 database query pattern
```al
if RentalUnit.FindSet() then
    repeat
        RentalLedger.SetRange("Unit No.", RentalUnit."Unit No.");
        if RentalLedger.FindSet() then
            repeat
                // Process each ledger entry
            until RentalLedger.Next() = 0;
    until RentalUnit.Next() = 0;
```
**After**: Single aggregated query
```al
RentalLedger.SetLoadFields("Required Fields");
RentalLedger.CalcSums("Aggregated Fields");
```

#### 3. Selective Field Loading
**Before**: Loading entire record
```al
if RentalLedger.FindSet() then
```
**After**: Loading only required fields
```al
RentalLedger.SetLoadFields("Field1", "Field2", "Field3");
if RentalLedger.FindSet() then
```

### Baseline Performance Characteristics (Without Knowledge)
This tier demonstrates optimization capabilities using only general database and programming principles, without Business Central-specific knowledge. Despite this limitation, substantial improvements were achieved through:
- **Fundamental SQL optimization principles** (aggregation over iteration)
- **General database access patterns** (reduce round trips, selective loading)
- **Algorithm optimization** (eliminate unnecessary nested loops)
- **Performance anti-pattern recognition** (N+1 queries, excessive field access)
