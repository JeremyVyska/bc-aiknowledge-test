# Performance Toolkit Testing Guide - Five-Tier Copilot Testing Protocol

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guide for executing performance measurements across all 5 testing tiers using Microsoft Performance Toolkit for Business Central.

**Date**: January 2025  
**Prerequisites**: BC 25, Performance Toolkit extension, all 5 tier extensions deployed

---

## 🔧 **Pre-Test Data Creation**

### **Step 1: Deploy Extensions**
Deploy all 5 tier extensions in the following order:
1. `Tier0-Performance-Baseline` (ID: 50100-50199)
2. `Tier1-Baseline-NoKnowledge` (ID: 50200-50299)
3. `Tier2-Community-Knowledge` (ID: 50300-50399)
4. `Tier3-Atomic-Knowledge` (ID: 50400-50499)
5. `Tier4-MCP-Enhanced` (ID: 50500-50599)

### **Step 2: Generate Test Data**
Run data generation **once** using any tier (data structure is identical):

**Recommended**: Use Tier 0 for data generation to avoid any optimization influence.

```al
// Execute in AL Console or via test codeunit
Codeunit.Run(Codeunit::"Test Data Generator"); // 50020
```

**Progress Monitoring**: The generator displays a progress dialog with:
- **Current Phase**: Units → Ledger Entries → Performance Stats
- **Percentage Complete**: Real-time progress tracking
- **Status Updates**: Current counts and processing information
- **Updates**: Every minute during ledger generation, every 5 buildings/100 units elsewhere

**Expected Results**:
- 5,000 Rental Units (50 buildings × 100 units each)
- 3,600,000 Monthly Rental Ledger entries (6 years × 12 months × 10 entries per unit per month)
- Performance Stats records initialized
- Data generation time: ~15-45 minutes depending on server performance

### **Step 3: Verify Data Population**
Confirm data creation success:
- **Rental Unit count**: Should be exactly 5,000 records
- **Monthly Rental Ledger count**: Should be 3,600,000 records
- **Date range**: January 2019 through December 2024
- **Revenue variation**: Check for seasonal patterns and realistic amounts

3. **Verify Compilation**: Ensure optimized code compiles successfully
4. **Run Performance Tests**: Execute Performance Toolkit job suite
5. **Record Results**: Capture all performance metrics

### **Phase 3: Results Analysis**
1. **Analyze Optimization Logs**: Run `AnalyzeOptimizationLogs.ps1 -GenerateReport` to process all tier logs
2. **Calculate Improvement Ratios**: Compare each tier to Tier 0 baseline
3. **Validate Optimization Quality**: Assess BC-specific knowledge application using logged decisions
4. **Cross-Reference Answer Key**: Validate optimization accuracy against expected patterns
5. **Generate Summary Report**: Document atomic knowledge effectiveness
